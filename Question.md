REST API is a web resource that is structured and written in a standardized way that allows us to communicate between the API and devices regardless of operating system. Other name for uses API's HTTP Methods. The most common HTTP Methods are GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.
POST is used to create. The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. POST (create) and PUT(update)
Record ID  which firebase sends to us after we create the entry. app we used "GET" to receive this record ID, saved it into a variable in our device struct, and then used "PUT" to update the database. Because on first step it is creating a new entry within the database and the second step is updating that entry. 
 A generic type is flexible as it allows you to use the behavior of any type. A generic type is reusable in varying contexts.
A URLRequest fetches the appropriate URL required to fetch the data using URLSession.
URL session coordinates data transfer tasks("GET", "PUT", "POST" and "DELETE"). It works by creating multiple "sessions" to coordinate the tasks.
In short, it makes a URL request and, once it gets a response, lets us run code to handle whatever it got back: possibly data. They are useful if you want things to be done asynchronously.
Fast to create new project. Easy to read.
